What is the **meaning and narrative** of Nurture?
`"Nurture" is a coined term combining "Nature" and "Future," carrying a hopeful message that mirrors how nature heals and grows, believing that humans can overcome their hardships and embrace a brighter future.

Who is the **audience**?

**Narrative strucutre**
`“Nurture” has a linear narrative structure, and the beginning and end of the album tracks are clear. Therefore, it can be interpreted in various ways according to the narrative that the reader follows. `

`“Nurture” is introspective and takes listeners on an emotional journey through themes of overcoming personal adversity. For the storytelling of the journey, the track list delicately expresses the sense of progression. ﻿
The first track of “Nurture”, lifelike, consists of sample pop and piano, which are the simplest and most basic sounds, so that listeners can naturally immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the album.
Tracks such as Look at the sky and Mirror create a contemplative atmosphere, gradually recovering as the album progresses, and in the second half of the album, the atmosphere changes with cheerful and energetic tracks such as Musician and Something Comforting, conveying hope and resilience to the listeners. . In “Nurture,” Porter Robinson explores his own struggles with mental health and the process of finding purpose and meaning in life, with lyrics and melodies that allow listeners to experience immersion in the emotions and themes presented by the author. .`

**Flashback**
`There are two main narrative techniques that Porter Robinson used. The first is flashback. Flashbacks present events or memories from the past to provide context or help understand the current narrative. In his music, he often references personal experiences and reflections alluding to past events. This aspect of the past contributes to the overall narrative by revealing his emotions and forming his current mindset. Also, the protagonist of the narrative is expressed through the artist himself. Although there is no specific fictional character or persona on the album, Robinson's personal experiences and emotions are the driving force behind the album's storytelling.`

Porter Robinson's storytelling in sound composition and lyrics 

`The first track of “Nurture,” lifelike, is instrumental music with no vocals composed of very basic sounds. “Nurture” approaches us cautiously with a familiar and natural sound. On his second track, Look at the sky, Porter Robinson shows his determination and hope. `

>Look at the sky, I'm still here

`"Look at the sky, I'm still here" and "I'll be alive next year" The repetition of the same lyrics shows themselves to move forward positively without giving up despite many challenges and failures. His first line, "Is it fate? If it's not easy, it must not be," talks about effort and perseverance in order to do something worthwhile, and as it progresses, Porter Robinson reveals his confidence in the lyrics. and show confidence. It conveys the message of perseverance in overcoming obstacles to achieve personal achievement and bring positive results. Soon, the track list gradually changes in a contemplative mood. In get you wish, the artist expresses a desire to make things right, but with the words "But it's no use, you said." However, these experiences suggest that you can ultimately gear up for your own growth. ﻿`

>you were the aftermath of every judgment

If you look closely at the lyrics of `Mirror, you will find that repeated words like "you were the aftermath of every judgment", "I know what you want from me", "I know what you're thinking," are self-awareness and others. Demonstrates feelings of understanding the expectations or judgments of others. The line "And it's not the voice of all the others, You've only said it to yourself" is because it affirms the notion that the thoughts and criticisms being expressed are internal, not external. ﻿ As the album progresses, the atmosphere becomes more and more comfortable and bright, and the atmosphere of the song changes to a cheerful, energetic and bright atmosphere. The phrase "You've taken me with you" in Blossom's lyrics implies that one's growth eventually includes all experiences. As the lyrics progress, it reflects the desire to save others from suffering by slowing down time and to create a perfect world where oneself is protected and free from suffering. However, interpretation of the entire album, including the lyrics, may vary depending on individual perspectives and experiences. `

**Time, Nature, Portal**

`Next, I explored three symbols used for storytelling. The first concept that often appeared in “Nurture” is “time”. Porter robinson's lyrics imply the fleeting nature of life and the content that he will do his best in the present time. It also indicates the inevitability of change and how important it is to value the time we have. The second symbol is "nature". In “Nurture,” nature uses itself as a metaphor in the life cycle of growth and regeneration. As mentioned earlier, Porter Robinson expresses his desire for pure beauty and harmonious existence found in nature in his music. The album name "Nuture" can be interpreted as regenerating and growing from wounds like nature and bringing another "Future". The third keyword is "portal". Transcending time and reality, through the sound and lyrics of Porter Robinson's music that connects him with his worldview, it gives listeners a sense of immersion as if they were transported to their own worldview through a portal. It metaphorically presents questions and answers to the self-reflection concerns that are experiencing. Through the process, it helps listeners to think and grow.`

`Porter Robinson communicates with the listener's emotions through "Nurture" by comparing personal and introspective lyrics with themes that anyone can relate to. By sharing vulnerable experiences and emotions, an atmosphere of sincerity is created, and stories are told with universal themes of self-discovery, personal growth, happiness and purpose, so that people can empathize step by step and form a bond with people who have similar difficulties and concerns. It was made to be able to.`
