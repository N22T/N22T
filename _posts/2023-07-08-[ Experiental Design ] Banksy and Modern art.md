Modern art and contemporary art are separated by time. Art historians and critics call the divergence between the 1960s and the 1970s the increasing flow of abstract expressionism.

Contemporary art tests our notions of "beauty." In contemporary art, we focus on the concept hidden behind rather than the visible beauty. After the 4th Revolution, the forms of art have become so diverse and the conditions have decreased. Pictures or graffiti drawn on the wall can now be photographed and sent to friends living on the other side of the globe, and art is developing in a form that is not affected by time and place.

A faceless painter, Banksy's works that cross the line between crime and art are a little different from the colorful graffiti we usually see on the street. This is because, using the stencil technique, he works quickly on the street and then disappears. Banksy often portrays himself as a rat in his work.

A man throwing a bouquet of flowers instead of a Molotov cocktail, a reporter filming a bleeding child in a war-torn home, and adults watching, Mickey Mouse holding the arm of a girl crying during the Vietnam War. It crosses fields such as politics and contains criticism of authoritative society and the world of art.

Banksy's work breaks down the notions we have about art and society and helps us find our own answers within them. Like a picture of Kia wearing a Burger King hat, a symbol of fast food, and a picture of a girl hugging a weapon of war and making a lovely expression, it expresses a critical meaning by combining two symbolically contrasting things.
